# MindfulMeals - New Contextual Mindfulness Approach

## üéØ Philosophy Change

**Old Approach**: Separate wellness tracking section with dedicated mindfulness features
**New Approach**: "Mindfulness should be woven into the natural flow of meal planning, not a separate wellness app"

## üîÑ Key Changes

### 1. Contextual Breathing (Not Forced)
- **Triggers based on user behavior**:
  - After 5 min of pantry organizing ‚Üí "Take a Breather" button appears
  - During cooking ‚Üí Breathing syncs with cook timer
  - All loading states ‚Üí Use breathing rhythm
  - Decision fatigue ‚Üí After 10+ min meal planning
  
### 2. Natural Integration Points
- **Post-meal reflections**: Smart 30-min notifications
- **Long-press actions**: Quick gratitude on meal cards
- **Time-based prompts**: Morning intentions, evening reflections
- **Stress detection**: Rushed navigation triggers gentle reminders

### 3. Adaptive Experience
- **UI adapts to user state**:
  - Low energy ‚Üí Energizing meal suggestions
  - Stressed ‚Üí Softer colors, calming animations
  - Grateful ‚Üí Celebration particles
  - Rushed ‚Üí Gentle "slow down" reminders

### 4. No Guilt, Only Encouragement
- Every feature is skippable
- "Skip for now" without guilt
- Celebration over correction
- No judgment language ever
