## 💡 Technical Notes

### Dependencies Used
- `react-native-linear-gradient` - Gradient backgrounds
- `react-native-push-notification` - Local notifications
- `@react-native-community/slider` - Energy level slider
- `react-native-haptic-feedback` - Vibration feedback
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local persistence

### Performance Considerations
- All animations use native driver where possible
- Reduced motion support built-in
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Efficient re-renders with proper memoization

## 📝 Developer Tips

### Testing Breathing Features
```bash
# Trigger 5-minute timer quickly for testing
# In PantryScreen.tsx, change:
# 5 * 60 * 1000 to 10 * 1000 (10 seconds)
```

### Notification Testing
- iOS Simulator: Notifications work but no sound
- Android: Full notification features available
- Check notification permissions in settings
