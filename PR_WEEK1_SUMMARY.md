# Pull Request: Week 1 - Frontend Foundation with Contextual Mindfulness

## 🎯 Summary

This PR establishes the frontend foundation for MindfulMeals with a new contextual mindfulness approach. The key philosophy shift is that mindfulness features are now woven naturally into the meal planning flow rather than being a separate wellness section.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Set up strict TypeScript configuration with modern features
- ✅ Installed all core and mindfulness-specific dependencies
- ✅ Configured React Query with mindful error handling
- ✅ Created comprehensive i18n system with 50+ translations

### API Layer
- ✅ Built axios client with auth interceptors and token refresh
- ✅ Created React Query hooks for:
  - Authentication (login/logout/status)
  - Pantry items (CRUD with gratitude notes)
  - Meal plans (AI generation with wellness tracking)

### Components & UI
- ✅ Refactored HouseholdSetup to use React Native Paper directly
- ✅ Created reusable components:
  - `PantryItem` - Displays items with expiry warnings and gratitude notes
  - `EmptyState` - Supports Lottie animations
  - Toast utility with mindful presets
- ✅ Updated all "Swasthya Food" references to "MindfulMeals"

### Navigation & Auth
- ✅ Implemented navigation with auth guard
- ✅ Created login screen with mock authentication
- ✅ Set up protected routes: Onboarding → Auth → Main App

### New Mindfulness Approach
- ✅ Installed packages for contextual features:
  - Push notifications for post-meal reflections
  - Background timers for cooking integration
  - Voice support for gratitude notes
  - Blur effects for meditation overlays
- ✅ Created comprehensive enhancement plan aligned with new philosophy

## 🚀 What's Next

Week 2 will focus on implementing the contextual mindfulness features:
- Floating "Take a Breather" button after 5 min of pantry organizing
- Mindful loading states with breathing rhythm
- Post-meal notification system (30 min delay)
- Contextual gratitude prompts
- Cooking timer with breathing sync

## 📝 Testing Instructions

1. Run the app: `cd mobile-app && npx react-native run-ios` (or run-android)
2. Test login with demo credentials:
   - Email: `demo@mindfulmeals.com`
   - Password: `demo123`
3. Navigate through onboarding and household setup
4. Verify all text displays correctly (i18n)
5. Check that navigation guards work properly

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Android directory needs to be initialized (documented in android-setup.md)
- Some TypeScript errors in existing screens (will be fixed as we implement features)
- Mock authentication is temporary for MVP

## 📊 Code Quality Metrics

- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- Components: Using React Native Paper directly (removed wrappers)
- API: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- i18n: Full English support, Hindi structure ready
