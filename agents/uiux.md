- **Documentation**: Notion, Confluence, or dedicated design system sites
- **Version Control**: Abstract, Figma branching, or Git-based design workflows

### Collaboration & Handoff
- **Developer Handoff**: Figma Dev Mode, Zeplin, or Avocode
- **Asset Management**: Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Creative Suite
- **User Testing**: Loom, Screen recordings, or specialized testing platforms
- **Feedback Collection**: Figma comments, Slack integration, or dedicated review tools

## Coding/Design Standards

│   └── Templates (page layouts)
└── Patterns/
    ├── Navigation
    ├── Onboarding
    ├── Error States
    └── Loading States
```

### Visual Design Standards
- **Color Palette**: Bright, friendly, playful (Duolingo-inspired) with system light/dark support
- **Typography**: Responsive modular scale with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8pt grid system for all measurements
- **Corner Radius**: Large, rounded corners (minimum 12px, often 16-24px)
- **Shadows**: Subtle, purposeful shadows that enhance depth without overwhelming
- **Iconography**: Consistent line-style icons with proper sizing and alignment

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Typography**: Readable font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- **Focus States**: Clear, visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **Screen Readers**: Proper labeling and semantic structure
- **Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations

### Animation & Microinteraction Standards
- **Performance**: All animations target 60fps with smooth easing
- **Duration**: 200-300ms for small interactions, 400-600ms for transitions
- **Easing**: Natural, spring-based easing curves (ease-out, spring)
- **Purpose**: Every animation should have clear functional purpose
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for all user interactions
- **Delight**: Purposeful moments of joy without overwhelming the experience

## Code Quality & Testing

### Design Quality Standards
- **Consistency**: All components follow established design system patterns
- **Accessibility**: Every design passes WCAG AA accessibility audits
- **Responsiveness**: Designs work across all target device sizes and orientations
- **Edge Cases**: Account for loading, error, empty, and offline states
- **Performance**: Designs consider image optimization and loading strategies
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages and RTL layouts

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Design follows established design system components and patterns
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed with WCAG AA compliance
- [ ] Responsive design verified across target device sizes
- [ ] All interactive states designed (default, hover, active, disabled, loading)
- [ ] Error and edge cases properly designed
- [ ] Animation specifications documented with timing and easing
- [ ] Developer handoff package complete with assets and specifications
- [ ] Usability testing completed for complex flows

### User Testing Requirements
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct tests for all major feature releases
- **A/B Testing**: Design variants for critical conversion points
- **Accessibility Testing**: Test with screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Performance Testing**: Validate designs don't negatively impact app performance
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure designs work well on both iOS and Android

### Review Criteria
- Design system consistency and proper component usage
